Code within the crypto package is taken from https://github.com/StylingAndroid/DataStore
Only minor changes were made when needed due to API changes.
The original author indicates an
    Apache-2.0 License
for this code.
My changes are to subtle to allow an indication of another license.

So code within this package will stay under
    Apache-2.0 License.
